      "description": "Hi, I'm Erin Franke. I currently attend Macalester College and am majoring in Statistics with Economics and Computer Science minors. I will be graduating in May 2023 and am interested in pursuing a career as a data scientist. This summer (2022) I joined the Minnesota Twins as a Baseball Research Fellow where I used R and SQL to apply statistical techinques in efforts to analyze players and baseball strategy. \n\nIn summer 2021 I was a research assistant at Carnegie Mellon University's Department of Statistics and Data Science where two other undergraduate students and I completed the project [\"Maximizing wOBA with Launch Angle and Exit Velocity\"](https://github.com/sarahsult/cmsacamp_baseball_project) advised by Adam Brodie (Houston Astros). A few other analytics projects I've recently worked on have incorporated [Bayesian techiques](https://tjpitchertrajectory.netlify.app/index.html) as well as spatial technqiues, in which I looked at [blood lead levels](https://github.com/efranke22/nick-erin-capstone) in the Twin Cities.\n",
