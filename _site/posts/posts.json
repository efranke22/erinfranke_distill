    "contents": "\nIn this project we conducted a survival analysis of the time from draft date to debut date for major league baseball players. Our analysis specifically focuses on the variables of fielding position and whether a player was drafted in high school or college, and how these differences change the length of a playerâ€™s time between being drafted and making their MLB debut. For the complete analysis, please use the following link to visit our website: https://coreyjpieper.github.io/survival-capstone/index.html\n\n\n\n",
