  Hi, I'm Erin Franke. I currently attend Macalester College and am majoring in Statistics with Computer Science and Economics minors. Currently I am working on an independent honors project related to the intersection of gentrification and crime [(github here)](https://github.com/efranke22/honorsGentrification). I will be graduating in May 2023 and am very excited to be joining Mayo Clinic as a Statistical Programmer.
