  Hi, I'm Erin Franke. I am currently a junior at Macalester College double majoring in Statistics and Economics with a passion for data analysis in sports and social good among other fields. This upcoming summer (2022) I am beyond excited to be joining the Minnesota Twins as a Baseball Research Fellow. 
  
  This past summer (2021) I was a research assistant at Carnegie Mellon University's Department of Statistics and Data Science where two other undergraduate students and I completed the project ["Maximizing wOBA with Launch Angle and Exit Velocity"](https://github.com/sarahsult/cmsacamp_baseball_project) advised by Adam Brodie (Houston Astros). Currently I am working on [an analytics project](https://tjpitchertrajectory.netlify.app/index.html) using Bayesian techniques related to Tommy John surgery and its impact on career trajectory for MLB pitchers.
