description: |
  Hi, I'm Erin Franke. I currently attend Macalester College and am majoring in Statistics with Economics and Computer Science minors. I will be graduating in May 2023 and am interested in pursuing a career as a data scientist. This summer (2022) I joined the Minnesota Twins as a Baseball Research Fellow where I used R and SQL to apply statistical techinques in efforts to analyze players and baseball strategy. 
  
  Currently I am working on an independent honors project related to the intersection of gentrification and crime [(github here)](https://github.com/efranke22/honorsGentrification). Another recent project I have worked on is a spatial analysis of [blood lead levels](https://github.com/efranke22/nick-erin-capstone) of children in the Twin Cities.
