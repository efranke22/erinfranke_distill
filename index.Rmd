  Hi, I'm Erin Franke. I am currently a student at Macalester College double majoring in Applied Mathematics & Statistics and Economics with a passion for data analysis in sports and social good among other fields. 
  
  This summer I was a research assistant at Carnegie Mellon University's Department of Statistics and Data Science where I worked Adam Brodie (Houston Astros), Sarah Sult (Washington University in St.Louis), and Brooke Coneeny (Swarthmore College) on our project ["Maximizing wOBA with Launch Angle and Exit Velocity"](https://sarahsult.github.io/cmsacamp_baseball_project/Presentations/Final%20Presentations/Full_Presentation.html#1). We are currently in the process of updating our model to account for the fact that when a hitter changes his attack angle, the pitches he receives and swings at change. We will be updating our slides to include our work on this topic shortly. For more information and code, please check out our [project repository](https://github.com/sarahsult/cmsacamp_baseball_project).
