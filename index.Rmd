  Hi, I'm Erin Franke. I am currently a student at Macalester College double majoring in Applied Mathematics & Statistics and Economics with a passion for data analysis in sports and social good among other fields. 
  
  This summer I was a research assistant at Carnegie Mellon University's Department of Statistics and Data Science where I worked Adam Brodie (Houston Astros), Sarah Sult (Washington University in St.Louis), and Brooke Coneeny (Swarthmore College) on our project ["Maximizing wOBA with Launch Angle and Exit Velocity"](https://sarahsult.github.io/cmsacamp_baseball_project/Presentations/Final%20Presentations/Full_Presentation.html#1). We are currently in the process of trying to weigh the impact of increasing attack angle on swing-and-miss rate.
