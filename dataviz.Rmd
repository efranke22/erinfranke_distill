Here are a collection of some data visualizations I have created starting in May 2021. Some are my favorite visualizations from the EDA portion of larger projects (during which I described where exactly the data were coming from and why), but most are either for the #TidyTuesday project or my own curiosity. Feel free to zoom in on specific graphs for more detail.
