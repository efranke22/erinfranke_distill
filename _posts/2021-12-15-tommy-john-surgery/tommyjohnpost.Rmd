In Fall 2021 I had the opportunity to take Bayesian Statistics (STAT 454) and complete a capstone project on a topic of choice. Hearing so much about the use of Bayesian techniques in sports, I decided to learn more about career trajectory for pitchers in the MLB, with a focus especially on Tommy John surgery. While my fall semester is now complete, I am looking to continue learning about this wide and complex topic whenever I have the time. My work will be updated on [**its website**](https://tjpitchertrajectory.netlify.app/index.html); please check it out and feel free to reach out to me with questions and/or suggestions!
